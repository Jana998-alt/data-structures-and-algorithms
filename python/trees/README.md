# Trees
rees is a data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children.

## Challenge
writing 3 different methods to Traverse through the tree.
building a binary search trees

## Approach & Efficiency

I took the approach of recursion for the Traversin g methods. which has big O of (n) of time and O(1) of space.

as of the binary search trees. the Big O of time is O(log(n)) and space O(1)

# Challenge Summary
Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

will use recursion and nested functions for this, to keep things neat.
Big O:
space: O(n)
time: O(n)
